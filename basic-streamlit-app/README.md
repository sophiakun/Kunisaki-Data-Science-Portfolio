# üêß Palmer Penguins Streamlit App

## Project Overview:

Welcome! This project is my first portfolio update of the semester and features an interactive **Streamlit application** built to explore the **Palmer Penguins dataset**. 

The app allows users to:
- Select and compare different penguin species
- Filter penguins by body mass using an interactive slider

This project marks the start of my portfolio journey, showcasing my ability to develop user-friendly, interactive data applications. Throughout the semester, I will continue refining past projects and building new ones to demonstrate growth in data science and Python development.

## Dataset Description:

The app loads "penguins.csv", which contains:

- Species
- Island
- Bill length & depth
- Flipper length
- Body mass
- Sex
- Year

### Run Locally

1. Open the terminal in VS Code
2. Navigate to the project folder
    - ls 
    - cd basic-streamlit-app/
    - streamlit run main.py
3. Install required Python libraries (if first-time user)
    - pip install pandas streamlit
4. Run code

### Necessary Libraries
- matplotlib 3.10.1
- pandas 2.2.3
- seaborn 0.13.2

## App Features:

- **Species Selection**:
  - Filter data by penguin species

- **Body Mass Filter**:
  - Use a slider to explore penguins across body mass ranges

- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Easily visualize key variables and trends in the dataset
