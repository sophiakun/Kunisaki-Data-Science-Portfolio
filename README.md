# 👩‍💻 Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!

Hello! This repository highlights my projects and technical skills from the course *Introduction to Data Science* at the University of Notre Dame. The purpose of this portfolio is to document my data science journey and share my work with the my peers, professors, employers, the Notre Dame community, and beyond.

As a senior graduating in May 2025, my hope is that I have evidence of my work in undergraduate data science classes for years to come!

## Organizational Plan

Each project will contain a:
- **Data Source**: a csv file that contains the dataset
- **Jupyter Notebook**: titled "main.py" to document code
- **README.md**: to describe what the project does and why the project is useful

## Projects

### **1. 🐧 Palmer Penguins Streamlit App**
[View](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)

The Streamlit project showcases my skills in building a Streamlit application. Specifically, the app allows users to explore the Palmer Penguins dataset interactively. Users can select different species of penguins and slides across a range of penguin body masses. 

Portfolio Significance:
- **Foundational Skills**: showcases my first attempt at building a user-friendly, interactive app 
- **Streamlit Practice**: demonstrates early development of UI components
- **Portfolio Launch Point**: serves as the starting project, setting the tone for future, more advanced projects!

### **2. 🏅 2008 Olympic Medalists Tidy Data**
[View](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

The tidy data project involves using **tidy data principles** to clean the data set [olympics_08_medalists.csv](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2008/). The dataset details 2008 Olympic medalists and their respective sports, genders, and medals won.  

Some key skills I demonstrated include using data clenaing tools in Pandas, such as  str.split() and str.replace(), data visualization tools in Matplotlib and Seaborn, and tidy data principles, ensuring that each variable is in its own column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit forms its own table.  

Portfolio Significance:
- **Data Wrangling**: demonstrates my ability to transform untidy data into tidy formats for better analysis
- **Libraries**: using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- **Visualization Growth**: builds on my visualization capabilities introduced in Portfolio 1, and adding more meaning to the data


### **3. ⚙️ Interactive Supervised Machine Learning Explorer**
[View Code](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) | [Launch App](https://kunisaki-data-science-portfolio.streamlit.app/)

Deployed to the Streamlit Community Cloud, the ML project shows my development of a machine learning application using Python and Streamlit. The app allows users to upload their own dataset, select and train a supervised machine learning model, experiment with hyperparameter tuning, and view model performance metrics. 

This app complements my portfolio by bridging the gap between data analysis and user experience (UI/UX) and interactivity, making data tools accessible to others.

Portfolio Significance:
- **Technical Skills**: showcases Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn expertise
- **ML Understanding**: demonstrates knowledge and implementation of classification algorithms
- **UI/UX Focus**: highlights user-friendly, interactive data science app development

### **4. 🔍 Interactive Unsupervised Machine Learning Explorer**
[View Code](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp) | [Launch App](https://kunisaki-data-science-portfolio-unsupervised-ml-app.streamlit.app/)

An interactive Streamlit app exploring **unsupervised machine learning** methods, including K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  
Users can apply clustering to classic datasets or their own CSV uploads, adjust hyperparameters, and visualize clustering results in 2D PCA space.

Portfolio Significance:
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: builds on the supervised ML app by expanding into unsupervised learning techniques
- **Advanced Visualizations**:  elbow plots, scree plots, cluster projections
- **Statistical Understanding**: shows knowledge of clustering evaluation (silhouette score, inertia) and dimensionality reduction (explained variance) metrics

## Skills Overview

- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, Scikit-learn
- **Data Cleaning:** melt(), pivot_table(), etc.
- **Interactive Applications:** develop strong UI/UX capabilities for seamless user interaction in Streamlit
- **Data Visualization:** sns.barplot(), sns.countplot(), sns.pairplot(), plt.pie() using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Supervised Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Unsupervised Models: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis
- **Model Deployment**: Hosting Streamlit apps on the web for public access

## Importance

This portfolio represents my progress in data science, from learning **data transformation skills** like cleaning and structuring data, to developing **interactive machine learning algorithms**.

In particular, both machine learning apps that I have built with Streamlit brings together my technical skills with tools like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Streamlit and exemplifies my ability to explain complex models and metrics in a clear, accessible way. Through these projects, I have presented data that is engaging for users, and that ultimately, tells a story. 

Thank you for taking the time to explore my data science portfolio! Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or discuss any of the projects you see here.
