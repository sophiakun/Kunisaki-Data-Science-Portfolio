# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository highlights my projects and technical skills from the course "Introduction to Data Science". The purpose of this portfolio is to document my data science journey and share my work with the my peers, professors, employers, the Notre Dame community, and beyond.

## Organization Plan

Projects will be organized into folders based on:

- **EDA**
- **Visualizations**
- **Models**

Each folder will contain:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: to document code
- **README.md**: to describe what the project does, why the project is useful, and who maintains and contributes to the project
