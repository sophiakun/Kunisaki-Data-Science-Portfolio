# üë©‚Äçüíª Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!

Hello! This repository highlights my projects and technical skills from the course "Introduction to Data Science". The purpose of this portfolio is to document my data science journey and share my work with the my peers, professors, employers, the Notre Dame community, and beyond. As a senior graduating in May 2025, my hope is that I have evidence of my work in undergraduate data science classes for years to come!

**Portfolio Update 1:** [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)

**Portfolio Update 2:** [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

**Portfolio Update 3:** [ML Streamlit App](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)

**Portfolio README:** [README.md](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md)

## Organizational Plan

Each project will contain a:
- **Data Source**: a csv file that contains the dataset
- **Jupyter Notebook**: titled "main.py" to document code
- **README.md**: to describe what the project does and why the project is useful

## Projects

### **1. üêß Palmer Penguins Streamlit App**
[View](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)

The Streamlit project showcases my skills in building a Streamlit application. Specifically, the app allows users to explore the Palmer Penguins dataset interactively. Users can select different species of penguins and slides across a range of penguin body masses. 

Some key skills I demonstrated include using Streamlit for interactive components, such as sliders and selection filters. This project complements my overall coding portfolio by showcasing my ability to **develop interactive web applications for data exploration**.

### **2. üèÖ 2008 Olympic Medalists Tidy Data**
[View](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

The tidy data project involves using **tidy data principles** to clean the data set [olympics_08_medalists.csv](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2008/). The dataset details 2008 Olympic medalists and their respective sports, genders, and medals won.  

Some key skills I demonstrated include using data clenaing tools in Pandas, such as  str.split() and str.replace(), data visualization tools in Matplotlib and Seaborn, and tidy data principles, ensuring that each variable is in its own column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit forms its own table.  

This project complements my data science portfolio by showcasing my ability to:
- **Transform unitdy data into tidy data** for better analysis
- **Create data visualizations** that add meaning to the data
- **Use various Python libraries** such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

### **3. ‚öôÔ∏è Interactive Supervised Machine Learning Explorer**
[View](https://github.com/sophiakun/Kunisaki-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)

Deploy to the Streamlit Community Cloud, the ML project shows my development of a machine learning application using Python and Streamlit. The app allows users to upload their own dataset, select and train a supervised machine learning model, experiment with hyperparameter tuning, and view model performance metrics. 

Portfolio Significance:
- **Technical Skills**: showcases Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn expertise
- **ML Understanding**: demonstrates knowledge and implementation of classification algorithms
- **UI/UX Focus**: highlights user-friendlu, interactive data science app development

## Skills Overview

- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
- **Data Cleaning:** melt(), pivot_table(), etc.
- **Interactive Applications:** using Streamlit
- **Data Visualization:** sns.barplot(), sns.countplot(), plt.pie() using Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Importance

This portfolio represents my progress in data science, from learning **data transformation skills** like cleaning and structuring data, to **data visualization**, where I have presented data that is engaging for users, and that ultimately, tells a story.
