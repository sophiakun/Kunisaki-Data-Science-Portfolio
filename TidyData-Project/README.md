#Project Overview:

This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing the 2008 Summer Olympic Medalists dataset using tidy data principles. I transformed the dataset so that:

- Each variable has its own column

- Each observation forms its own row

- Each type of observational unit forms its own table

My objectives are to clean, transform, and then do basic exploratory data analysis on the data. These tidy data principles are important because they make data analysis easier by standardizing one structure. This project includes exploratory data analysis through visualizations and a pivot table aggregation to provide deeper insights from the cleaned data.

#Instructions:

1. Open the terminal in VS Code
2. Navigate to the project folder
    - ls 
    - cd TidyData-Project/
3. Install required Python libraries (if first-time user)
    - pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
4. Run code

#Dataset Description:

###2008 Summer Olympic Medalists Dataset:

"olympics_08_medalists.csv" adapted from [here](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2008/)

The dataset lists every athlete who one a medal in the 2008 Olympic Games, and their correspodning gender/sport, and medal won (gold, silver, or bronze).

Some pre-processing steps that I took were standardizing column names, reshaping data using the melt() command,
splitting the combined gender-sport variable into separate columns, and finally, removing unnecessary characters (underscores) and formatting inconsistencies (capitalization).
